# Moneyhub Tech Test - Investments and Holdings

At Moneyhub we use microservices to partition and separate the concerns of the codebase. In this exercise we have given you an example `admin` service and some accompanying services to work with. In this case the admin service backs a front end admin tool allowing non-technical staff to interact with data.

A request for a new admin feature has been received

## Requirements

- An admin is able to generate a csv formatted report showing the values of all user holdings
    - The report should be sent to the `/export` route of the investments service
    - The investments service expects the csv report to be sent with content-type application/json 
    - The csv should contain a row for each holding matching the following headers
    |User|First Name|Last Name|Date|Holding|Value|
    - The holding should be the name of the holding account given by the financial-companies service
    - The holding value can be calculated by `investmentTotal * investmentPercentage`
- Ensure use of up to date packages and libraries (the service is known to use deprecated packages)
- Make effective use of git

## Updated README

### New routes
- / getcsv route in admin directory

### How to run tests
- to run the tests please run the script npx mocha

### Additional questions
1. How might you make this service more secure?
Easiest way would be by adding API authentication with a JWT token, and adding a middleware in the ednpoint that verifies this with a JWT secret. I added the package helmet for some basic security measures

2. How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?
By using a relational database like mySQL. I would add the rows of data in their own respective tables and join them as necessary and send it through the endpoints

3. What else would you have liked to improve given more time?
The Readme is a little bit unclear

## Getting Started

Please clone this service and push it to your own github (or other) public repository

To develop against all the services each one will need to be started in each service run

```bash
npm start
or
npm run develop
```

The develop command will run nodemon allowing you to make changes without restarting

The services will try to use ports 8081, 8082 and 8083

Use Postman or any API tool of you choice to trigger your endpoints (this is how we will test your new route).

### Existing routes
We have provided a series of routes

Investments - localhost:8081
- `/investments` get all investments
- `/investments/:id` get an investment record by id
- `/investments/export` expects a csv formatted text input as the body

Financial Companies - localhost:8082
- `/companies` get all companies details
- `/companies/:id` get company by id

Admin - localhost:8083
- `/investments/:id` get an investment record by id
